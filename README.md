Developed an equity portfolio management strategy using historical stock data from 2018 for 10 tech stocks (IBM, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, FB, NFLX, TSLA, ORCL, SAP). Managed a $5M fund with a "5-day rebalancing" strategy, alternating between buying low and buying high based on adjusted closing prices. Evaluated portfolio performance by comparing MTM (Mark-to-Market) value against a custom high-tech index and USD/JPY exchange rates. Analyzed optimal rebalancing intervals to maximize returns. Visualized portfolio performance trends through data analysis and time-series plots. (Data was collected from Yahoo finance)
